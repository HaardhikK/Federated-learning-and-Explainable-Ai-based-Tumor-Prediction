# Brain Tumor Detection using Federated Learning  

This project implements a **hybrid deep learning framework** that integrates **ResNet50** and **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** for enhanced feature extraction in brain tumor detection. The baseline **CNN model** achieved **86.46% accuracy**, while **ResNet50** alone improved it to **90.24%**. The **proposed federated learning architecture** further optimized performance, achieving a **final accuracy of 96.07%** by leveraging decentralized training across multiple healthcare institutions.  

To enhance interpretability, **Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, LIME and SHAP**, were integrated to highlight model decision-making areas, ensuring alignment with clinically relevant tumor features. The federated approach not only enhances generalization but also **preserves patient data privacy** by training models locally without sharing raw medical images, addressing compliance with **HIPAA and GDPR** standards.
